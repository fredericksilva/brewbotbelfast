## Brewbot Journey Beers

Below is a list of the beers that have stood-out to the team during our Brewbot journey. We'd love to stock each and every one of them in the bar.

- [BrewDog's Punk IPA](https://www.brewdog.com/beer/headliners/punk-ipa) • Scotland
  - One of the first craft beers to make it into our office was Punk IPA.
- [Sierra Nevada's Pale Ale](http://www.sierranevada.com/beer/year-round/pale-ale) • Chico, CA
  - A clone of Sierra Nevada's Pale Ale was one of the first recipes we ever brewed.
- [Deschute's Black Butte XX/XXI](http://www.deschutesbrewery.com/brew/black-butte-xxi-porter) • Portland, OR
  - We joined Dave Shea in The Green Dragon and talked about beer for hours. He suggested we try this and we were blown away. For once it was Chris who fell asleep and not Jonny.
- [Ninkasi's Total Domination](http://www.ninkasibrewing.com/delicious/beers/flagship-series/total-domination.html) • Eugene, OR
  - Ninkasi's beers always ended up in our Airbnb fridge. We liked the beers so much we made a point of stopping by the brewery for a tour on our RV trip from Portland to San Francisco during the Kickstarter campaign.
- [Russian River's Pliny the Elder](http://russianriverbrewing.com/brews/pliny-the-elder/) • Santa Rosa, CA
  - But of course. Pliny, the elusive bottle, or even rarer, on draught, we always seemed to seek it out when we came across it. The beer is steeped in aura and Ali and Jonny made the trip from Austin, TX to Santa Rosa, CA to sample the beer straight from the brewery. We celebrated our Kickstarter success with a bottle of Pliny in The Hudson Bar   and later Vinnie would submit the recipe to our platform.
- [Firestone Walker's Wookey Jack](http://www.firestonebeer.com/beers/products/wookey-jack) • Paso Robles, CA
  - Wookey Jack was a standout Black IPA from our first trip in Portland in 2012, sampling it first at Belmont Station.
- [Hopworks Ace of Spades](http://hopworksbeer.com/organic-ace-of-spades) • Portland, OR
  - Jonny's first beer in Portland, purchased at The Green Dragon in the company of Chris, Ali and Andy McMillan just days before our first XOXO event - the event that inspired us to build Brewbot.
- [Stone's Arrogant Bastard Ale](http://www.arrogantbastard.com/arrogantbastard/default.asp) • Escondido, CA
  - Jonny and Chris brown-bagged Arrogant Bastards on their way from Tornado (San Francisco) to meet the rest of the team at another bar during the campaign. We were suffering a mid-campaign lull and our moods were down but en route to meet up with everyone we were notified that Stefan backed us for the Brewbot + Hop 'N Roll Tour pledge, bringing us over the half-way mark from 50% to 56% pledged. We jumped up and down a lot that night.
- [Galway Bay's Of Foam & Fury](http://www.galwaybaybrewery.com/offoamandfury/) • Galway, Ireland
  - It was the signature beer of the Brewbot Hop 'N Roll Tour and Chris Treanor, the head brewer, later submitted the recipe to our platform to allow others to brew it for themselves.
- [Dogfish Head 60/90/120 min](http://www.dogfish.com) • Delaware
  - Too many stories involving Dogfish Head's IPAs.
- [Jester King's Atrial Rubicite](http://jesterkingbrewery.com/beers/#beers_310) • Austin, TX
  - Absolute stand-out beer from Jester King Brewery. We organised a trip to the ranch for the Techstars team… memories of Settlers of Catan, Cards Against Humanity, long waits on pizza and being eaten alive by bugs. It's so good Jonny bought the t-shirt.
- [Alesmith Speedway Stout](http://www.ratebeer.com/beer/alesmith-speedway-stout/14232/) • San Diego, CA
  - We met Stephen McNamara, one of our Kickstarter backers, during the campaign at The City Beer Store for a a few beers. This was the last one we shared before parting ways.
- [Elevation's 7437](http://www.elevationbeerco.com/beer/black-diamond/7437-2/) • Colorado
  - A corked double IPA by Austin-based brewery Elevation.
- [Dale's Pale Ale](http://brew.oskarblues.com/ob-beers/year-round/dales-pale-ale/) • Colorado
  - Techstars!
- [Dale's G'knight](http://brew.oskarblues.com/ob-beers/year-round/gknight/) • Colorado
  - Techstars!
- [Beavertown Bloody 'Ell](http://www.ratebeer.com/beer/beavertown-bloody-ell/213354/) • London, England
  - When Adam and Greg joined we celebrated over a few of these in The Woodworkers.
