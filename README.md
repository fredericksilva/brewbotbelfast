# Brewbot Belfast

In an effort to build the best beer destination we can we are opening up the development of our bar. This might just be the first bar on Github. If you like, fork it, and make it better.

Our vision for Brewbot Belfast is to build a bar that listens and learns so it can evolve to become a place people have shaped.

We are interested in the whole process of brewing beer, from the hops picked by the farmer all the way to your glass. This new space will serve as a giant test lab for us to not just learn and innovate on technology but rethink service, dispensing and what it really means to create a destination for people to come and enjoy beer.

We have the freedom to serve up the most crazy concoctions and see if they work or not â€” and if they don't, tell us. We are adopting an iterative approach to running our bar and we're looking forward to seeing how you shape it.
