        <h2>Our vision</h2>

        <p>In an effort to build the best beer destination we can, we are opening up the development of our bar. This might just be the first bar on <a href="https://github.com/teambrewbot/brewbotbelfast">Github</a>. Feel free to fork it and make it better.</p>

        <p>Our vision for Brewbot Belfast is to build a bar that listens and learns so it can evolve to become a place people have shaped.</p>

        <cite>— Patsy's Parlour (legacy version of the bar, March '15)</cite>

        <p>We are interested in the whole process of brewing beer, from the hops picked by the farmer all the way to your glass. This new space will serve as a giant test lab for us to not just learn and innovate on technology but rethink service, dispensing and what it really means to create a destination for people to come and enjoy beer.</p>

        <p>We have the freedom to serve up the most crazy concoctions and see if they work or not — and if they don't, tell us. We are adopting an iterative approach to running our bar and we're looking forward to seeing how you shape it.</p>

        <h2>Join us</h2>

        <p><strong>Work in a bar dedicated to craft beer and fuelled by Brewbots!</strong></p>

        <p>At <a href="http://www.brewbot.io">Brewbot</a> our vision is to create the largest connected network of breweries in the world and now we finally have a place we can call home. Since our Kickstarter campaign we have been on a mission to rethink how beer is brewed and distributed. Now, we are creating a Brewbot Bar for people to indulge in everything that is great about beer culture, somewhere to learn about the brewing process in a hands-on way by actually brewing beer for themselves, and generally geek-out over one of the many world-class craft beers we'll have in stock.</p>

        <p>We are looking for enthusiastic, talented, beer-loving individuals to join the Brewbot family on both a full and part-time basis. You will have a special opportunity to help shape the future of our first bar and be a key part of this exciting new adventure. Your role will be to welcome people to the bar, helping both beer connoisseurs and newcomers navigate their way through a world of beer to discover new favourites.</p>
